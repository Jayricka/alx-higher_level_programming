# Python - Import & Modules
This project focuses on the concepts of importing functions, creating modules, and utilizing command line arguments in Python. The README.md file provides an overview of the tasks and their respective descriptions, including the expected inputs and outputs.

## Tasks
* **Task 0: Import a simple function from a simple file**
  * [0-add.py](./0-add.py): contains a Python program that imports the function def add(a, b): from [add_0.py](./add_0.py). Upon execution, it prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3.

* **Task 1: My first toolbox!**
  * [1-calculation.py](./1-calculation.py):This program imports functions from [calculator_1.py](./1-calculator.py) and prints the results of various arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) between the numbers 10 and 5.

* **Task 2: How to make a script dynamic!**
  * [2-args.py](./2-args.py): prints the number of arguments passed to it, followed by the list of arguments. The output format includes the position of each argument, its corresponding value, and a separator for clarity.

* **Task 3: Infinite addition**
  * [3-infinite_add.py](./3-infinite_add.py): By running this program you can obtain the sum of all the arguments provided as input to the program.
  * Output: Sum of the arguments followed by a new line.

* **Task 4: Who are you?**
  * [4-hidden_discovery.py](./4-hidden_discovery.py): Executing this program will print all the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc. The output displays each name on a separate line, excluding names starting with __, and is sorted alphabetically.

* **Task 5: Everything can be imported**
  * [5-variable_load.py](./5-variable_load.py):The Python program imports the variable a from [variable_load_5.py](./variable_load_5.py) and prints its corresponding value.

* **Task 6: Build my own calculator!**
  * [100-my_calculator.py](./100-my_calculator.py): To utilize a calculator-like functionality, execute this program. With three command line arguments: <a>, <operator>, and <b>. The program imports all functions from [calculator_1.py](./calculator_1.py) and performs the specified arithmetic operation, displaying the result. The available operators are +, -, *, and /. Incorrect usage or an unknown operator will prompt an error message.

* **Task 7: Easy print**
  * [101-easy_print.py](./101-easy_print.py): The Python program prints the phrase #pythoniscool followed by a new line on the standard output. This is achieved without using the print, eval, open, or sys functions.

* **Task 8: ByteCode -> Python #3**
  * [102-magic_calculation.py](./102-magic_calculation.py): The file contains a Python function that corresponds to a specific bytecode provided by Holberton School.

* **Task 9: Fast alphabet**
  * [103-fast_alphabet.py](./103-fast_alphabet.py): Executing this program will print the uppercase alphabet followed by a new line. The program achieves this without using loops, conditionals, the str.join() method, string literals, or system calls.
